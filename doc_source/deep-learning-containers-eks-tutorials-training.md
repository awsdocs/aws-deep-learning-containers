Once you've created a cluster using the steps in [Amazon EKS Setup](deep-learning-containers-eks-setup.md), you can use it to run training jobs\. For training, you can use either a CPU, GPU, or distributed GPU example depending on the nodes in your cluster\. The topics in the following sections show how to use Apache MXNet \(Incubating\), PyTorch, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow 2 training examples\.
